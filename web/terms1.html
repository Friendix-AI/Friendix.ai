        <h1>Terms of Service for Friendix.ai</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 15, 2025</p>

        <h3>1. Agreement to Terms</h3>
        <p>By accessing or using our web application, Friendix.ai (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms
            of Service ("Terms") and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the
            Service.</p>

        <h3>2. The Service</h3>
        <p>Friendix.ai provides a conversational AI service allowing users to chat with various AI companions, including
            "Luvisa", and record personal thoughts in a "Secret Journal". It also allows users to create temporary,
            password-protected group chats called "Together Spaces".
        </p>

        <h3>3. User Accounts</h3>
        <p>To use our Service, you must create an account by providing a valid email address and creating a password.
            You are responsible for safeguarding your password and for any activities or actions under your account. You
            agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.</p>

        <h3>4. User Content</h3>
        <p>You are responsible for all the content, including text, messages, journal entries, and profile information
            (like your display
            name, status, and avatar) that you provide to the Service ("User Content").</p>
        <p>You retain ownership of your User Content, but you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license
            to use, store, and process this content solely for the purpose of operating, providing, and improving the
            Service (e.g., to save your chat history and provide it to our AI provider for generating responses).</p>
        <p>We are not responsible for the accuracy or nature of the content generated by the AI.</p>

        <h3>5. Together Spaces</h3>
        <p>"Together Spaces" are temporary and designed for ephemeral group conversations. Any chat history and data
            associated with a "Together Space" are automatically and permanently deleted 5 minutes after its creation.
            You are responsible for any content shared within these spaces.</p>

        <h3>6. Prohibited Conduct</h3>
        <p>You agree not to use the Service to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Violate any applicable national or international law or regulation.</li>
            <li>Send any harassing, abusive, threatening, or obscene material.</li>
            <li>Transmit any viruses, worms, or other malicious software.</li>
            <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems, database (MongoDB), or other user accounts.</li>
            <li>Use the Service to generate content that infringes on any proprietary right of any party.</li>
            <li>Scrape, reverse-engineer, or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7. Third-Party Services</h3>

            terms and policies:</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>

        <h3>8. Termination</h3>

        <h3>9. Disclaimers</h3>
        <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We make no warranty that the Service will be
            uninterrupted, secure, or error-free. The AI-generated responses are for entertainment purposes only and
            should not be considered as medical, legal, or financial advice.</p>

        <h3>10. Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p>In no event shall Friendix.ai, nor its directors, employees, or partners, be liable for any indirect,
            incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits,
            data, or other intangibles, arising out of or in connection with your use of the Service.</p>
